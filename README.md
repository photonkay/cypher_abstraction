# Cypher: StayingCoded

Cypher is developed by us to encrypt and decrypt our messages.

## Features
- **Encryption:** Convert plain text messages into encrypted texts.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt previously encrypted messages to retrieve the original.

## Usage

### Encryption
To encrypt a message, use the following command:

```bash
python encryption.py input_file_path output_file_path
```

- `input_file_path`: The path to the file containing the message you want to encrypt.
- `output_file_path`: The path where the encrypted message will be saved.

### Decryption
To decrypt a message, use the following command:

```bash
python decryption.py input_file_path
```

- `input_file_path`: The path to the file containing the encrypted message.
Note: Encrypted file is overwritten with the decrypted. Works like magic.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/photonkay/cypher_abstraction.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd cypher_abstraction
    ```

3. Encrypt or Decrypt as specified in the usage
